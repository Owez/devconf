# devconf

Contains my common config files to make a nice looking dev machine.

## Installing

Each folder, such as `vim/` contains tool-specific `install.sh` files which will automatically install what the given `README.md`'s say. Here's an overview of the usage of each directory:

- `hack/`: Hacking/pentesting tools
- `misc/`: Majority of apt installs, contains misc development packages/setups
- `shell/`: ZSH and aliases setup
- `vim/`: Custom vimrc and general vim setup
