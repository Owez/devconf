# devconf

Contains my common config files to make a nice looking dev machine.

## Installing

If you'd like to install a specific section of my development configuration, you may use the `install.sh` files included within directories such as `vim/`. If on the other hand you'd like to install everything from scratch, you may do so by using the root-level `install.sh` file which iterates over the directories.
